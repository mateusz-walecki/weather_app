What should be done:

- Create a single React App
- Create a page with single select with options "London", "München"
- Fetch data for selected option - city for example `https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=München,us&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22`
- Display in table all results "dt_txt", "humidity", "temp" - see `data.png`
